/**
 * @file analysis.h
 * @brief Header file for the Analysis class, a class designed to streamline
 * the running of multiple samples through CAFAna.
 * @details The Analysis class operates under the principle that the full
 * dataset in an analysis is comprised of multiple samples, each of which
 * represents a different component of the signal or background. Under this
 * paradigm, an analysis consists of running the same set of variables/cuts
 * on each sample, and then combining the results at the end. The Analysis
 * class is designed to facilitate this process by allowing the user to
 * specify the variables and cuts to be applied to each sample, along with the
 * full list of samples to be run. The class then handles the running of the
 * samples and the storing of the results.
