# Description
This directory contains the python scripts that are used to analyze the various root files output from `xsec_analyzer`.

# Setup
## First time setup
Ensure that you have python setup on your machine. You can check this by running `python --version` in your terminal.

If it is installed, you can run the following command to install the required packages:
```bash
source init.sh
```

## Setup area
If you have already run the above command, at least once, you should have a virtual environment setup in the `venv` directory. You can activate this environment by running:
```bash
setup.sh
```
